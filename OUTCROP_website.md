We aim to determine the typical seismic properties (wave speeds & anisotropy) and water content of a volcanic arc root section (lower crust and mantle), a key building block in the formation of the continental crust. For the seismic properties we use a two-step approach, performing direct measures in exhumed deep rocks and the estimate their properties at such... For water tracing, FTIR and for the first time LIBS spectroscopy. The core team is based at University of Oviedo and the IACT-CSIC in Granada with collaborations from Geosciences Montpellier (France) and the UMA.

## Why the OUTCROP project?

The lower crust has become the focus of recent attention as we now better understand that its properties are relevant to understand earth dynamics, the chemical origin of rocks and assembly of continental crust, the role of fluids at depths, and seismology (e.g. achieve high-resolution images of the lithosphere)1,2,3,4,5. The lower crust of subcontinental and transitional tectonic plates is, however, the lesser-known section of the "rigid" outer layer of the Earth known as the lithosphere. Located at depths of ~15-40 km, beyond the current drilling limit, only indirect methods (i.e. geophysical surveys) probe the present-day lithosphere's structure (radial and lateral) at such depths. However, achieving high-resolution images and composition of the depth lithosphere from seismic or magneto-telluric data requires precise knowledge of density, elastic properties, and water content of rocks at those depths. We aim to limit this rock properties in a very particular tectonic environment, a volcanic arc root section. These sections are  of great interest to earth scientist for a variety of reasons. the First... crust-mantle boundary, the Moho, 



The key to solving this puzzle can lie in the study of exhumed portions of the lower crust (granulite terrains) and mantle brought to the surface during tectonic events. 

On the other hand, **water content** affects several key physical properties of rocks: melting temperature, rheology, diffusion, elastic/seismic properties and electrical conductivity. It is also key for a correct estimate of *P* and *T* based on thermodynamic modelling (i.e. water fugacity). At depths below 15 km, water is mostly contained within hydrous minerals, such as mica and amphibole, that become unstable at the elevated *P* and *T* typical of the lower crust. Indeed, the continental lower crust and the mantle are generally considered dry11 (i.e. no free fluids at phase boundaries). During exhumation, water-unsaturated dry rocks react with any available water to produce hydrous minerals that may obscure the hydrated or dry nature of the pristine rock. The determination of trace amounts of water (OH & H) in the crystalline structure of persistent nominally anhydrous minerals (NAMs) is the only gateway to prove the existence of water at these depths, provided that NAMs behave as closed systems during exhumation13. However, the water content in the lower crust remains highly unconstrained due to measurement limitations in NAMs: low water content, and FTIR orientation biases caused by the high anisotropy of most minerals forming the lower crust. **New procedures to overcome these limitations will be developed within the OUTCROP project.**

In a nutshell, with the outcomes of the OUTCROP project, we will be able to answer questions that have direct applications for geophysicists (modelling the state of deformation and strain rates in the lithosphere), seismologists (e.g. infer composition & structure from seismic data) and petrologists (understanding the processes that make up the lithosphere), and boost the state of the art of different techniques that serve to constrain seismic anisotropy and water content of deep rocks.
