**The OUTCROP project at a glance**

The OUTCROP project stands for _From the L**o**wer Cr**u**st to the man**t**le: elasti**c** p**r**operties and water c**o**ntent of the Cabo Ortegal com**p**lex_. This is a research project attached to a...starting in December 2021 and funded by... We aim to determine the typical seismic velocities and anisotropy and water content of a root volcanic arc section (lower crust and mantle), a key building block in the formation of the continental crust. ... The core team is based at University of Oviedo (Geology and Physics Departments) and the IACT-CSIC in Granada, with collaborations from Geosciences Montpellier (France) and the UMA.

## Why the OUTCROP project?

The lower crust of subcontinental plates, at depths ~15-40 km beyond the current drilling limit, is the lesser-known section of the "rigid" outer layer of the Earth (aka, the lithosphere). Geophysical surveys probe the present-day Earth's structure (radial and lateral) at such depths. However, achieving high-resolution images of the lithosphere and composition from seismic or magneto-telluric data requires precise knowledge of density, elastic properties, and water content of rocks at those depths.
