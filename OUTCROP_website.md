>This is a research project funded by a Margarita Salas ESTABILIZACIÓN grant from the [PCTI-Asturias](http://www.ficyt.es/pcti/index.asp) (Spain) started in December 2021 and led by Marco A. Lopez-Sanchez (PI) at [Uniovi](https://www.uniovi.es/en/inicio). We aim to determine the average seismic properties (wavespeeds & anisotropy) and water content of a volcanic arc root section (lower crust and mantle), a key building block in the formation of the continental crust where these parameters are not well constrained. To estimate seismic wavespeeds and anisotropy, we will use a two-step method, making direct measurements on rocks exhumed from the lower crust and lithospheric mantle, and then modelling the average rock properties at depth (a.k.a. the rock & fabric-recipe approach). For water tracing, we will use [FTIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier-transform_infrared_spectroscopy) and, in a pioneering way, [LIBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser-induced_breakdown_spectroscopy) spectroscopy on nominally anhydrous minerals (NAMs). The core team is shared between the University of Oviedo (Asturias, Spain) and the IACT-CSIC in Granada (Spain) with collaborations from Geosciences Montpellier (France) and the University of Málaga (Spain).

## Why the OUTCROP project?

The lower crust has become the focus of recent attention as we now better understand that its properties are relevant to understand [earth dynamics](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.earth.36.031207.124326), the [chemical origin of rocks](https://doi.org/10.1029/95RG01302), the [assembly of continental crust](https://doi.org/10.1038/srep33517), the role of [fluids at depths](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-earth-060614-105224), or [seismology](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-earth-050212-124117) (e.g. achieve high-resolution images of the lithosphere). The lower crust of subcontinental and transitional tectonic plates is, however, the lesser-known section of the "rigid" outer layer of the Earth known as the lithosphere. Located at depths of ~15-40 km, beyond the current drilling limit, only indirect methods such as geophysical surveys probe the present-day lithosphere's structure (radial and lateral) at such depths. However, achieving high-resolution images and composition of the depth lithosphere from seismic or magneto-telluric data requires precise knowledge of density, elastic properties, and water content of rocks at those depths. We aim to limit these rock properties in a quite particular tectonic environment, a volcanic arc root section. These tectonic areas are of great interest to earth scientist for a variety of reasons but the two main ones are...TODO crust-mantle boundary, the Moho, 

To estimate what average physical properties characterise the rocks at these still inaccessible depths, Earth scientists usually study exhumed portions of the lower crust, known as granulite terrains, and mantle brought to the surface during tectonic events. The presence of such rocks at the Earth’s surface is however limited and scattered worldwide. In turn, these terrains always raise the question as to whether the rocks observed at the present surface are representative of those once resided at deep where pressure exceeded 0.6 GPa. This is, whether the exhuming process might induce important chemical and/or physical changes in the rocks modifying their original properties. Another desirable feature to find in such deep exhumed terrains is the crust-mantle transition (i.e. the Mohoroviĉić discontinuity or *Moho*), a first-order sharp seismic discontinuity in the Earth where the P wave velocities increases from ~7 to 8 km s<sup>-1</sup> with broad implications for lithospheric strength models and seismic interpretation. The presence of the *Moho* in place is rare for continental or transitional granulite sections. A granulite terrain with exceptional qualities for determining seismic properties should meet the following criteria: (1) allow a systematic study of their properties (fairly good rock exposure), (2) include the crust-mantle transition, and (3) allows reconstruction of its properties over time (i.e. mineral/microstructure changes induced by the exhumation process are easily identifiable). **Determine the typical seismic properties and water content of a granulite terrain that has these features and gaining knowledge on how these vary with mineralogical changes caused by their tectonic evolution is a central goal of the OUTCROP project**.

**Water content** affects several physical properties of rocks such as melting temperature, rheology, diffusion, elastic/seismic properties, and electrical conductivity. It is also key for a correct estimate of *P* and *T* based on thermodynamic modelling (i.e. water fugacity). At depths below 15 km, water is mostly contained within hydrous minerals, such as mica and amphibole, that become unstable at the elevated *P* and *T* typical of the lower crust. Indeed, the continental lower crust and the mantle are generally considered dry (i.e. no free fluids at phase boundaries). During exhumation, water-unsaturated rocks react with any available water to produce hydrous minerals that may obscure the hydrated or dry nature of the pristine rock. The determination of trace amounts of water (OH & H) in the crystalline structure of persistent nominally anhydrous minerals (NAMs) is the only gateway to prove the existence of water at these depths, provided that NAMs behave as closed systems during exhumation. Despite this, the water content in the lower crust remains highly unconstrained due to measurement limitations in NAMs: low water content and FTIR orientation biases caused by the high anisotropy of most minerals forming the lower crust. **We also aim to develop new procedures to overcome these limitations within the project.**

In a nutshell, with the OUTCROP project we will be able to answer questions that have direct applications for geophysicists (modelling the state of deformation and strain rates in the lithosphere), seismologists (e.g. infer composition & structure from seismic data) and petrologists (understanding the processes that make up the lithosphere), and boost the state of the art of different techniques that serve to constrain seismic anisotropy and water content of deep rocks.

## How will we do it?

The project is subdivided into five work packages summarized in figure 1.

**Seismic properties** of deep rocks (> 15 km) can be measured using two approaches: direct laboratory measurements using high-temperature (*HT*) high-pressure (*HP*) devices or calculated from mineral content and rock microstructure (i.e. modelling). Laboratory measurements are challenging. First, the number of measures allowed is usually fewer than that required to characterize the full elastic tensor that allows estimating the seismic wave speeds in any direction and, thus, the full anisotropy. Second, the range in applied *P* and *T* does not cover the conditions at the lower crust and mantle, e.g. *P* are usually limited to <0.5 GPa (lower crust >0.6 GPa) and only room *T* applies for setups that allow restoring the full elastic tensor. The confining pressure is a key factor because at high pressures the bulk rock density and the crystal preferred orientation (CPO) of anisotropic minerals control the elastic properties and seismic anisotropy at dry conditions. Another main limitation is the tiny size of the sample required by high-pressure devices that often prevent representative measurements in the laboratory, especially for the lower crust and mantle rocks where the grain size is usually in (or close to) the centimetre range. At pressures above ~0.6 GPa, seismic wave speeds are [no longer influenced by extrinsic factors such as microcracks and pores](https://doi.org/10.1029/JB079i002p00407) (the high confining pressures cause pores/cracks to collapse) and this makes the approach based on modelling the most suitable for the study case, where pressures exceeded 1.0 GPa (Fig 2).

**Water content** controls several physical properties of rocks: melting temperature, diffusion, seismic speeds, rheology, or electrical conductivity. It is also key for a correct estimate of *P* and *T* based on thermodynamic modelling (i.e. water fugacity). At depths below 15 km, H₂O is mostly contained within hydrous minerals, such as mica and amphibole, that become unstable at the elevated *P* and *T* typical of the lower crust. Indeed, the continental lower crust and the mantle are [generally considered dry](http://dx.doi.org/10.1144/0016-76492008-101) (i.e. no free fluids at phase boundaries). During exhumation, water-unsaturated dry rocks react with any available water to produce hydrous minerals that may obscure the hydrated or dry nature of the pristine rock. The determination of trace amounts of water (hydroxyl & hydrogen) in the crystalline structure of persistent nominally anhydrous minerals (NAMs) is the only gateway to prove the existence of water at these depths, provided that NAMs behave as closed systems during the exhumation. Water content of NAMs in the lower crust is not well constrained due to measurement difficulties with traditional FTIR (i.e. due to low water content, with H₂O-carrying capacity of ~100-1000 _ppm_ in common NAMs and FTIR orientation biases caused by the high anisotropy of most of the minerals forming the lower crust). We aim to determine water content in NAMs using three spectroscopy methods: [FTIR](), [RAMAN]() and [LIBS]()...TODO



### The target section

The [Cabo Ortegal Complex (COC)]() is a well-exposed metamorphic terrane in north-western Spain (Fig. 2a). It includes high-_P_ and high-_T_ rocks surrounded by arc-volcanic and oceanic-derived rocks. The high-_P_ and high-_T_ unit is condensed in a sequence of ~1 km thick that contains four major mappable rock units (Fig. 1b). So far, most studies focused on the geological history of the COC terrane rather than their physical properties with few exceptions ([Brown et al. 2009](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2009.05.032); [Llana-Fúnez and Brown, 2012](https://doi.org/10.1130/B30568.1)). The general structure, local composition, deformation/metamorphic sequence, and geochronology is thus fairly known. Petrologic and chemical criteria indicate that the high-_P_ granulites and the underlying mantle rocks belong to a transitional (island-arc root) lower crust section (e.g. [Galán and Marcos, 1997](https://doi.org/10.1007/s005310050162); [Moreno et al., 2001](https://doi.org/10.1144/jgs.158.4.601); [Tilhac et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/egw064)). The most striking feature of the COC section, however, is that it exposes a full transitional section from the lower crust upper to the mantle (i.e. the [Moho discontinuity lies in situ](https://doi.org/10.1007/s005310050162)) which is a rare occurrence for a continental or transitional section. The focus on this particular section is twofold: the seismic properties of this type of transitional lithosphere differ significantly from those of the continents (the [Moho appears as a fuzzy discontinuity](https://doi.org/10.1029/95JB00259)) and they have been proposed as [one of the places where the continental Moho can originate](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature12758), hence its major scientific interest in geosciences.

The COC rock sequence records changes in mineralogy and microstructure due to the exhumation. Peak pressure and temperature conditions, metamorphic events, and mineral assemblages are summarized in figure 2d. Mantle rocks show pervasive [serpentinization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpentinite) with the original microstructure locally preserved. Lower crustal rocks record three major metamorphic events (Fig. 2d). High-_P_ granulites in contact with mantle rocks, referred to as massive granulites, preserve eclogite (high-_P_ high-_T_ rocks) lenses that record the highest pressure conditions (event M1), later transformed into granulites (event M2) characterized by the presence of garnet, clinopyroxene, plagioclase and the lack of orthopyroxene. Above these, i.e. further away from the Moho, there is layered granulites made up of minerals characteristic of more moderate pressures and temperatures  (e.g. hornblende) referred to as the metamorphic event M3 caused by the rock exhumation process (Fig. 2d), yet partially preserving the high-_P_ mineral assemblages representing the event M2. Plastic deformation causing the layering and the strong resetting of preferred orientation of the minerals mainly occurred at the transition from M2 to M3 event. Data on water content on NAMs formed during the *high-_P_ high-_T_* metamorphism is yet to be reported. Overall, the local preservation of high-_P_ mineral assemblages and microstructure and the state-of-the-art on the general metamorphism of the COC make these rocks an exceptional target to study how the seismic response varies during exhumation of the lower crust. We will focus the collection of samples on the Uzal area (Fig. 2b), where the lower crust section outcrops with the best conditions and the Moho lies in situ.
